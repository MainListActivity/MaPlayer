// The proxy engine logic has been migrated to Rust (rust/src/).
// Rust-side tests live in rust/tests/ and are run via `cargo test`.
// This file previously contained Dart-only proxy controller tests that
// are no longer applicable after the migration.
//
// Integration tests for the Dart↔Rust FRB wrapper will be added once
// the full build pipeline (Task 9/10) is verified.
